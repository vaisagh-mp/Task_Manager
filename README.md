# Task Manager

A simple task management web application built with Django, allowing users to create, update, delete, and filter tasks, with sorting and searching features.

## How to Run the Program

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd task_manager
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

If you donâ€™t have a virtual environment, create one with:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

Install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

Make sure your database schema is up to date by running:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```


### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now, you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Assumptions & Design Decisions

- **Database**: The application uses SQLite by default. You can configure it to use PostgreSQL or MySQL by adjusting the `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`.
- **Form Handling**: Django's `ModelForm` is used to handle task creation and updating.
- **Frontend Design**: The user interface is simple and straightforward using basic HTML and CSS.
- **Task Status**: Task status can be either `pending` or `completed`. You can add or modify the choices if needed.
- **Task Priorities**: Tasks are classified into `high`, `medium`, and `low` priority. You can modify these priority levels based on your needs.
